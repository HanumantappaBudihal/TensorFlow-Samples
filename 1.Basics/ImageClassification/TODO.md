The task of identifying what an image represents is called image classification. An image classification model is trained to recognize various classes of images. For example, you may train a model to recognize photos representing three different types of animals: rabbits, hamsters, and dogs. TensorFlow Lite provides optimized pre-trained models that you can deploy in your mobile applications

This tutorial follows a basic machine learning workflow:

Examine and understand data
Build an input pipeline
Build the model
Train the model
Test the model
Improve the model and repeat the process
